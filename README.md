# Essential Typescript Utils!

Essential Typescript utils is a collection of useful common used Javascript utilities written in Typescript.

## ðŸŽ‰ How to use

```typescript
import { sum } from 'essential-ts-utils'

const total = sum(5, 4)
console.log('The total of 5 + 4 equals ', total)

```

## ðŸš© Linting

### Prettier
Nicer code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/)!


### Commitlint
You might want to remove or customize [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).
Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format. But in case you are using JIRA you might want to have a different commit message structure, example [here](https://github.com/Gherciu/commitlint-jira] or [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitlint-config-jira]


## ðŸš€ Typescript
This project is written to typescript. If you aren't that familiar with typescript this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet) is a great resource to get familiar.

## ðŸŒ² Tree Shakeable
Tree shaking is a method of optimising our code bundles by eliminating any code from the final file that isnâ€™t actually being used.
When using these utils you are garanteed that you will only import the functions you actually use in your code. Resulting in a smaller bundle size!

This is especially important for people like me who have [BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/).
