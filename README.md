### ðŸš© Linting

#### Prettier
Nicer code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/)!


#### Commitlint
You might want to remove or customize [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).
Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format. But in case you are using JIRA you might want to have a different commit message structure, [example](https://github.com/Gherciu/commitlint-jira) and [another](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitlint-config-jira)

To launch the commit helper:
```
yarn commit
```


### ðŸš€ Typescript
This project is written to typescript. If you aren't that familiar with typescript this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet) is a great resource to get familiar.


### ðŸŒ² Tree Shakeable
Tree shaking is a method of optimising our code bundles by eliminating any code from the final file that isnâ€™t actually being used.
When using these utils you are garanteed that you will only import the functions you actually use in your code. Resulting in a smaller bundle size!

This is especially important for people like me who have [BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=essential-ts-utils).
